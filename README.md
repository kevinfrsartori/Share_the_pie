## A shiny app to visualize selection indice of candidate genes against whole genome distribution.

Genetic polymorphism (π) is a measure of the nucleotide diversity between individuals of a species. Computing such indice, genome-wide and for a large sample, is made accessible to bioinformaticians through codes and data publicly available (e.g. phytozome). However, it is still not easily available to a large majority of scientists lacking bioinformatic expertise. 
"Share the pie" project aims at creating a bridge between molecular biologists, ecologists and evolutionists by sharing pre-computed selection scans such as π, across individuals and species. It provides an interactive platform to access and visualize selection metric distributions, and the code behind is made available.
